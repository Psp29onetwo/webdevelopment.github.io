the Unix command line, Node.js, Express.js, Git and version control, APIs, EJS, SQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 
Also, this course has various challenges and projects along the way. The objective is to complete the course, and 
as I progress, complete each project along the way. Upon completion, I will earn my certification of full stack development.
